				<p>For most individual investors looking to ‘do it themselves’, assembling a well-diversi ed investment portfolio can be time consuming and expensive. But at Luceo Asset Management, by starting with the advice process and matching your recommendation with the best investment manager, we make the process straightforward.</p>
			</div>

This give you instant access to a wide range of high quality funds managed by the most capable fund managers. But you don’t pay management fees for several funds. Instead, you just pay for one.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-4">
				<h3 class="yellow">ONGOING MANAGEMENT</h3>
				<p>Your investment managers don’t just build portfolios; they never stop working hard to make sure they keep performing. This means constantly monitoring investment markets, as well as extensively researching a vast number of different funds.

					<h3 class="orange">WE CAN ASSIST WITH MANAGING YOUR RISK</h3>
					<p>These investments put your capital at risk and there is a chance you may not get back
						the full amount invested. Investment markets can be volatile and, as the value of markets goes up and down, the value of your portfolio will change too. The extent to which your investment may rise and fall will depend on the combination of different assets within your portfolio. It is therefore important to agree with your adviser the portfolio that accurately reflects your tolerance for risk and capacity for losses.
						</p>

						<h3 class="yellow">PORTFOLIO RETURN & GOALS</h3>
						<p>The past performance of an investment is not a reliable indicator of future results. Nor should you rely on any forecasts made about future returns. We can’t guarantee the level of capital gains or income generated by your investment.</p>

						<h3 class="black">ALL INVESTMENTS CARRY AN ELEMENT OF RISK, AND LUCEO INVESTMENT FUNDS ARE NO EXCEPTION. YOU SHOULD TALK TO YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.</h3>
